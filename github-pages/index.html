            <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

            <p>
              Jack Plowman's Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an
              assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. We use four
              rings with the following semantics:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>ADOPT</strong> — Add Description
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>TRIAL</strong> — Add Description
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>ASSESS</strong> — Add Description
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>HOLD</strong> — Add Description

            </ul>

            <h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

            <p>
              The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support Engineering teams
              at Zalando to pick the best technologies for new projects; it
              provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in
              technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously
              evolve our technology landscape. Based on the
              <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar"
                >pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a
              >, our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are
              interesting in software development — changes that we think our
              engineering teams should pay attention to and use in their
              projects.
            </p>

            <h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>

            <p>
              The Tech Radar is maintained by our <em>Principal Engineers</em> —
              who facilitate and drive the technology selection discussions at
              Zalando across the Engineering Community. Assignment of
              technologies to rings is the outcome of ring change proposals,
              which are discussed and voted on. The Tech Radar is open for
              contribution for all Engineering teams at Zalando and depends on
              their active participation to share lessons learned, pitfalls, and
              contribute to good practices on using the technologies.<br />
